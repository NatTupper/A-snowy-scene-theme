# Icy
A theme I made for AwesomeWM

I used the [powerarrow-dark theme](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats/tree/master/themes/powerarrow-dark) as a base for this theme. Much of the nitty gritty stuff comes from that theme.

Included is an old version of lain that works with this theme. Lain can be found [here](https://github.com/lcpz/lain).

## Installation
1. Copy the icy and lain directories into ~/.config/awesome directory.
2. Copy the template provided and modify it as you wish.
